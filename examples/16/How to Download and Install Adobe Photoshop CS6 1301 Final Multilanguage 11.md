## Step 2: Extract the RAR File
 
After downloading the software, you need to extract the RAR file using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip. To do that, right-click on the file and choose "Extract Here" or "Extract to adobe-photoshop-cs-6-13.0.1-final-multilanguage-cracked-dll-ching-liu". This will create a folder with the same name as the file.
 
## Step 3: Run the Setup File
 
Inside the folder, you will find a file called "Set-up.exe". This is the setup file that will install Adobe Photoshop CS6 on your computer. Double-click on it and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to accept the license agreement, choose the installation location, and select the components you want to install.
 
## Step 4: Replace the Cracked DLL File
 
The last step is to replace the original DLL file with the cracked one. This will activate Adobe Photoshop CS6 and allow you to use it without any limitations. To do that, go to the installation folder of Photoshop, which is usually C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS6 or C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS6. Then, find a file called "amtlib.dll" and rename it to "amtlib.dll.bak". This will create a backup of the original file in case you need it later.
 
Next, go back to the folder where you extracted the RAR file and open a subfolder called "cracked dll". There, you will find another file called "amtlib.dll". Copy this file and paste it into the installation folder of Photoshop, replacing the original one.
